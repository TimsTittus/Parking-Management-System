<h2 id="Brief overview of project">Brief overview of project</h2>
<p>This is a project based on Parking Management. The program helps us to enter, display or alter the details of vehicles in parking records.
Moreover & most importantly the program helps us to know the present status of a parking detail, vehicle detail etc.
It includes various function programs to do the above mentioned tasks.</p>

<p></p>Data file handling has been effectively used in the program.
The database is a collection of interrelated data to serve multiple applications. That is database programs create files of information. So we see that files are worked with most, inside the program.

<h2 id="Software and Hardware requirement">Software and Hardware requirement</h2>
<h4>Software specification</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Operating System: 	Windows 7</li>
  <li>Platform: 	Python IDLE 3.7</li>
  <li>Database:	MySQL</li>
  <li>Language: 	Python</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hardware specifications</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Processor: 	Dual Core & Above</li>
  <li>Hard Disk: 	40GB</li>
  <li>RAM: 1024MB</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Advantages of project">Advantages of project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is a greater sense of security due to the fact that patrons do not actually walk to and from their own space.</li>
  <li>It is highly feasible for extremely small sites that are unable to accommodate a conventional ramped parking structure.</li>
  <li>There is high parking efficiency (i.e. sf/space and cf/space).</li>
  <li>There is no need for driving while looking for an available space.</li>
  <li>Emissions are greatly brought down and reduced.</li>

  <li>The patrons wait for their car in a highly controlled environment.</li>
  <li>There are less chances for vehicle vandalism.</li>
  <li>There is a minimal staff requirement if it is used by known parkers.</li>
  <li>It is possible that the retrieval time is lower than the combined driving/parking/walking time in conventional ramped parking structures.
      There is an easier facade integration since there are no ramping floors or openings in exterior walls.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Limitations of project">Limitations of project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There is a greater construction cost per space (but this may be offset by the chance for lesser land costs per space and the system manufacturers say that the operating and maintenance cost will be lower as       compared to a conventional ramped parking structure).</li>
  <li>Use of redundant systems will result in a greater cost.</li>
  <li>It may be a bit confusing for unfamiliar users.</li>
  <li>It is not recommended for high peak hour volume facilities.</li>
  <li>There may be a fear of breakdown (How do I get my car out?).</li>
  <li>There is an uncertain building department review and approval process.</li>
  <li>It requires a maintenance contract with the supplier.</li>
</ul>
